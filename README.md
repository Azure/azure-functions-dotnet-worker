# Azure Functions .NET Isolated

Welcome to .NET Isolated in Azure Functions. .NET Isolated provides .NET 5 support in Azure Functions. It runs in an out-of-process language worker that is separate from the Azure Functions runtime. This allows you to have full control over your application's dependencies as well as other new features like a middleware pipeline.

A .NET Isolated function app works differently than a .NET Core 3.1 function app. For .NET Isolated, you build an executable that imports the .NET Isolated language worker as a NuGet package. Your app includes a [`Program.cs`](FunctionApp/Program.cs) that starts the worker.

## Binding Model

.NET Isolated introduces a new binding model, slightly different from the binding model exposed in .NET Core 3 Azure Functions. More information can be [found here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/wiki/.NET-Worker-bindings). Please review our samples for usage information.

## Middleware

The Azure Functions .NET Isolated supports middleware registration, following a model similar to what exists in ASP.NET and giving you the ability to inject logic into the invocation pipeline, pre and post function executions.

## Samples

The samples for .NET Isolated using various Azure Functions bindings are available under `samples/SampleApp` ([link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/tree/main/samples/SampleApp)).

## Create and run .NET Isolated functions

**Note: Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code support is on the way. In the meantime, please use `azure-functions-core-tools` or the sample projects as a starting point.**

### Install .NET 5.0
Download .NET 5.0 [from here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)

### Install the Azure Functions Core Tools
Please make sure you have Azure Functions Core Tools >= `3.0.3388`.

To download, please check out our docs at [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools)

### Create a .NET Isolated project
In an empty directory, run `func init` and select `dotnet (Isolated Process)`.

### Add a function
Run `func new` and select any trigger (`HttpTrigger` is a good one to start). Fill in the function name.

### Run functions locally
Run `func host start` in the sample app directory.

**Note:** If you selected a trigger different from `HttpTrigger`, you may need to setup local connection strings or emulator for the trigger service.

### Attaching the debugger

#### Visual Studio

>_Release candidate instructions. Requires RC packages_

> NOTE: To debug your Worker, you must be using the Azure Functions Core Tools version 3.0.3381 or higher

In your worker directory (or your worker's build output directory), run:
```
func host start --dotnet-isolated-debug
```

Core Tools will run targeting your worker and the process will stop with the following message:

```
Azure Functions .NET Worker (PID: <process id>) initialized in debug mode. Waiting for debugger to attach...
```

Where `<process id>` is the ID for your worker process. 

At this point, your worker process wil be paused, waiting for the debugger to be attached. You can now use Visual Studio to manually attach to the process (to learn more, see [how to attach to a running process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/attach-to-running-processes-with-the-visual-studio-debugger?view=vs-2019#BKMK_Attach_to_a_running_process))

Once the debugger is attached, the process execution will resume and you will be able to debug.

**YOU CAN NOT DEBUG DIRECTLY USING "Start Debugging" IN VISUAL STUDIO DIRECTLY.** You need to use the command line as mentioned in the previous **Run the sample locally** part of this readme.

We're working with the Visual Studio team to provide an integrated debugging experience.

## Deploying to Azure

### Create the Azure resources

1. To deploy the app, first ensure that you've installed the Azure CLI. 

2. Login to the CLI.

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

3. If necessary, use `az account set` to select the subscription you want to use.
  
4. Create a resource group, Storage account, and Azure Functions app. If you would like to use an existing Windows .NET Core 3 function app, please skip this step.

    ```bash
    az group create --name AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --location westeurope
    az storage account create --name <STORAGE_NAME> --location westeurope --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --sku Standard_LRS
    az functionapp create --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --consumption-plan-location westeurope --runtime dotnet --functions-version 3 --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME>
    ```


### Deploy the app

1. Ensure you're in your functions project folder.
2. Deploy the app.

    ```bash
    func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME>
    ```
## Known issues

* Optimizations are not all in place in the consumption plan and you may experience longer cold starts.
