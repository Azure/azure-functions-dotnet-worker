# AZFW0003: Invalid base class for extension startup type

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW0003|
| **Category** |[Startup]|
| **Severity** |Error|


## Cause

This rule is triggered when a worker extension startup type is not derived from `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Core.WorkerExtensionStartup` class.

## Rule description

Extensions which are interested in participating in the application startup routine should do the below steps.

1. Create a class which derives from `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Core.WorkerExtensionStartup`. Override the `Configure` method to configure the application as needed.
2. Use the `WorkerExtensionStartup` assembly attribute and pass the type information of the newly created extension startup class.

If the type information passed into `WorkerExtensionStartup` assembly attribute is a type which is not derived from the `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Core.WorkerExtensionStartup` class, this rule will be triggered.

## How to fix violations

To fix violations, derive the extension startup type from `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Core.WorkerExtensionStartup` class.

Sample code with violation, before the fix

```cs
[assembly: WorkerExtensionStartup(typeof(FooExtensionStartup))]

public class FooExtensionStartup
{
    public override void Configure(IFunctionsWorkerApplicationBuilder applicationBuilder)
    {
        // configure applicationBuilder as needed.
    }
}
```

Sample code, after the fix

```cs
[assembly: WorkerExtensionStartup(typeof(FooExtensionStartup))]

public class FooExtensionStartup : WorkerExtensionStartup
{
    public override void Configure(IFunctionsWorkerApplicationBuilder applicationBuilder)
    {
        // configure applicationBuilder as needed.
    }
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

This rule should not be suppressed, if extensions want to participate in startup.
