# AZFW0005: Multiple Azure Functions Binding Attributes grouped together

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW0005|
| **Category** |[AzureFunctionsSyntax]|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when multiple Azure Functions Binding Attributes are grouped together on a method, parameter, or property syntax.

## Rule description

Azure Functions Binding Attributes are used to decorate a method, parameter, or property syntax. Only one binding can be associated with any syntax.

## How to fix violations

If you have multiple bindings on a property syntax, refactor your code to create new properties to handle the different bindings. Create only one binding per property.

If you have multiple bindings on a parameter syntax, refactor your code to add new parameters to handle the different bindings. Create only one binding per parameter.

If you have multiple bindings on a method, create a custom return type with the Output Binding attributes decorating the custom return type's properties. Create only one binding per property. See the documented guidance for [multiple Output Bindings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide#multiple-output-bindings) for more information.

## When to suppress warnings

This rule should not be suppressed because this error will prevent your Azure Functions from running.
