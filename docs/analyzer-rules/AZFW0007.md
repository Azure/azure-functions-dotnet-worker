| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW0007|
| **Category** |[FunctionMetadataGeneration]|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when the number of arguments provided to a Binding attribute do not match the expected number of arguments in the Attribute's symbol's constructor.

## Rule description

In Azure Function metadata generation, arguments provided to a binding attribute are matched to arguments in the symbol representation of the attribute's constructor. The arguments in the attribute and those in the constructor must match exactly.

## How to fix violations

Check if you are using the correct attribute. Make sure you are applying the correct number of arguments.

## When to suppress warnings

This rule should not be suppressed because this error will prevent your Azure Functions from running.
