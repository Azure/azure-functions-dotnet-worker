# AZFW0008: Invalid Cardinality

| **Severity** |Error|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when an input or trigger binding of an Azure Function has an invalid cardinality.

## Rule description

"Cardinality" dictates whether or not an input is batched together or processed individually. It is defined by using the argument "IsBatched" in an input or trigger binding attribute. When IsBatched is true, cardinality is set to `Many`. When IsBatched is false, cardinality is set to `One`.

All input and trigger bindings must correctly declare a compatible "IsBatched" value and parameter input type. For example, for bindings where `IsBatched = true`, the input parameter type must be an iterable collection like `string[]` or `List<string>`. Combining `IsBatched = true` with a parameter of `string[]` is valid, but combining `IsBatched = true` with a parameter of `string` is invalid.

_**Note:**_ The default value of `IsBatched` changes depending on the binding type. The default value of `IsBatched` for each type can be found in the dotnet-isolated [extensions libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/tree/main/extensions). If a value is not explicitly provided in the named arguments of the attribute, the default value will be used.

## How to fix violations

If an input or trigger binding has `IsBatched = true` (explicitly or by default), the input parameter type must be changed to an iterable collection. Otherwise, `IsBatched` needs to be set to false.

## When to suppress warnings

This rule should not be suppressed because this error will prevent your functions from running.
