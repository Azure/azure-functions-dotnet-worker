# AZFW0009: Invalid use of SupportsDeferredBinding attribute

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW0009|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when the `SupportsDeferredBinding` attribute is used on any class other
than an input (`InputBindingAttribute`) or trigger (`TriggerBindingAttribute`) binding based class.

## Rule description

The `SupportsDeferredBinding` attribute is used to determine if a binding supports deferred binding.
Currently, this feature is only supported for input and trigger bindings. Output bindings are not supported
and this attribute should not be used on any other class type.

## How to fix violations

Remove the use of the `SupportsDeferredBinding` attribute from your class.

## When to suppress warnings

This rule should not be suppressed because this error may prevent your Azure Functions from running.
