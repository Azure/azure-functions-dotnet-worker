# AZFW0010: Invalid binding type

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW00010|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Warning|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when a function is binding to a type that is not supported
by the binding attribute being used.

## Rule description

Some bindings advertise the types that they support. If a binding advertises supported types
and does not support falling back to built-in converters, then this rule will will be flagged.

For example if you're binding to a `QueueTrigger` and the only supported type is `string` and
your function is binding to a `bool`, then you will see this warning.

## How to fix violations

Change the binding type to a type that is supported by the binding your function is using.

### Supported Types

You can refer to the [public documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-blob?tabs=in-process%2Cextensionv5%2Cextensionv3&pivots=programming-language-csharp) to see which types are supported.

| Binding | Supported Types |
| ------- | --------------- |
| BlobTrigger | POCO, String, Stream, Byte[], BlobClient*, BlobContainerClient |
| BlobInput | POCO, IEnumerable*<POCO>, String,  IEnumberable<String>, Stream, IEnumberable<Stream>, Byte[], BlobClient, IEnumerable<BlobClient>, BlobContainerClient |
| CosmosDBTrigger | POCO, IEnumerable<POCO> |
| CosmosDBInput | POCO, IEnumerable<POCO>, CosmosClient, Database, Container |
| EventGridTrigger | String, IEnumerable<String>, CloudEvent, IEnumerable<CloudEvent>, EventGridEvent, IEnumerable<EventGridEvent> |
| EventHubTrigger | POCO, POCO[], String, String[] |
| QueueTrigger | POCO, String, BinaryData, QueueMessage |
| ServiceBusTrigger | String, String[], ServiceBusReceivedMessage, ServiceBusReceivedMessage[] |
| TableInput | POCO, IEnumerable<POCO>, TableEntity, IEnumerable<TableEntity>, TableClient |

> \* Where `BlobClient` is supported AppendBlobClient, BaseBlobClient, BlockBlobClient and PageBlobClient are also supported
