# AZFW0010: Invalid binding type

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW00010|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Warning|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when a function is binding to a type that is not supported
by the binding attribute being used.

## Rule description

Some bindings advertise the types that they support. If a binding advertises supported types
and does not support falling back to built-in converters, then this rule will will be flagged.

For example if you're binding to a `QueueTrigger` and the only supported type is `string` and
your function is binding to a `bool`, then you will see this warning.

## How to fix violations

Change the binding type to a type that is supported by the binding your function is using.
