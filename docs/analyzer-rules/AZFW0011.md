# AZFW0011: Invalid binding type

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW00011|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when a function is binding to a non-iterable type for a  blob container path.

## Rule description

For a function that has a BlobInput attribute with a container path, the parameter must be of iterable type such as `IEnumerable<T>`.

For example, if your function has attribute `BlobInput("container")` and it is binding to a `string`, then you will see this error.


## How to fix violations

Change the binding type to an iterable type such as `IEnumerable<T>` or provide blob path `container/blob` instead of container path for non-iterable binding type.

### Supported Types

You can refer to the [public documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-blob?tabs=in-process%2Cextensionv5%2Cextensionv3&pivots=programming-language-csharp) to see which types are supported for blob container.

| Binding | Supported Types |
| ------- | --------------- |
| BlobInput | IEnumerable*<POCO>, IEnumberable<String>, IEnumberable<Stream>, IEnumerable<BlobClient>, BlobContainerClient |

> \* Where `BlobClient` is supported AppendBlobClient, BaseBlobClient, BlockBlobClient and PageBlobClient are also supported
