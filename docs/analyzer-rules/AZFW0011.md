# AZFW0011: Invalid binding type

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW00011|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when a function is binding to a non-iterable type for a blob container path.

## Rule description

When using the `BlobInputAttribute` with a container path, the target parameter must be of iterable type such as `IEnumerable<T>` except when binding to `BlobContainerClient`.

Example, if your function uses `BlobInput("<container path>")` and it is binding to a `string`, this rule will be violated.

## How to fix violations

Change the binding type to an iterable type such as `IEnumerable<T>` or provide blob path `container/blob` instead of a container path when using a non-iterable binding type is desired.

### Supported Types

You can refer to the [public documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-blob?tabs=in-process%2Cextensionv5%2Cextensionv3&pivots=programming-language-csharp) to see which types are supported for blob container.
