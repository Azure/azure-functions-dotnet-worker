# AZFW0012: Invalid Retry Options

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW0012|
| **Category** |[AzureFunctionsSyntax]|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when a retry attribute is incorrectly used on an Azure Function.

## Rule description

This rule is triggered in two scenarios:

- A retry strategy is not recognized (only Fixed Delay and Exponential Backoff are supported)
- A retry attribute is used on a trigger type that does not support function-level retry.

A list of triggers that support function-level retry can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-error-pages?tabs=fixed-delay%2Cin-process&pivots=programming-language-csharp#retries).

## How to fix violations

Use the supported retry attributes on the correct trigger types. This information can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-error-pages?tabs=fixed-delay%2Cin-process&pivots=programming-language-csharp#retries).

## When to suppress warnings

This rule should not be suppressed because this error will lead to unexpected retry behavior.
