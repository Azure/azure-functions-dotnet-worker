# AZFW0013: Unable to parse binding argument

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW0013|
| **Category** |[AzureFunctionsSyntax]|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when a binding attribute argument is an invalid or null value.

## Rule description

[Attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/) are used to define bindings, and the function metadata generator parses the arguments passed into these attributes to generate binding information during start up.

If the arguments passed in are invalid for any reason (such as being null), this rule is enforced.

## How to fix violations

Review the binding attribute.

## When to suppress warnings

This rule should not be suppressed because this error will prevent your functions from running.
