# AZFW0011: Missing Registration for ASP.NET Core Integration

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW00014|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Warning|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when the ASP.NET Core Integration function app has an incorrect method registered instead of the expected method.

## Rule description

The ASP.NET Core function app should have registration for `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication()` method. This rule will be violated when the app is registering `ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults()` instead of the correct registration for `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication()`.


## How to fix violations

Replace registration for `ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults` by  `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication` method in the Function App. Refer to [public documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration) for guidance on ASP.NET Core Integration.

## When to suppress warnings

It is okay to suppress this warning if `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication` is called indirectly through a different method off the IHostBuilder.
