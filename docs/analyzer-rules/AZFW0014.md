# AZFW0011: Missing Registration for ASP.NET Core Integration

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW00014|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when worker using the ASP.NET Core Integration uses `ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults()`.

## Rule description

When using the ASP.NET Core Integration, the worker must configure the worker using the `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication()` method. This rule will be violated when the worker uses  `ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults()`.


## How to fix violations

Replace usage of `ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults` with  `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication` method in the Function App. Refer to [public documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration) for guidance on ASP.NET Core Integration.


## When to suppress

It is okay to suppress this if `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication` is called indirectly through a different API.
