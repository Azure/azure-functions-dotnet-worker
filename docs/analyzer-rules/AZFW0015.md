# AZFW0015: Redundant usage of local.settings.json in the worker configuration

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW00015|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Warning|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when `local.settings.json` is passed to `AddJsonFile()` method of the `IConfigurationBuilder`.

## Rule description

`local.settings.json` is a file that is automatically loaded to the configuration by Azure Functions Core Tools.
There is no need to explicitly add it to the configuration of the worker during development. And in production scenarios `local.settings.json` should never be used because it means checking it into the source control.
And this a securiy risk because this file usually contains sensitive information like connection strings.


## How to fix violations

Don't pass `local.settings.json` to `AddJsonFile()` when configuring the Azure Functions Worker.


## When to suppress

It is okay to suppress the warning if it happens in a code block that is guaranteed to execute only during the development (Debug configuration) and you want to be extra explicit about the source of configuration. It should never be suppressed for code that will run in production.
