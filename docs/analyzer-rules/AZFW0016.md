# AZFW0016: Missing HttpResult attribute for multi-output function

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW00016|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Warning|

## Cause

This rule is triggered when a multi-output function using `HttpResponseData` is missing a `HttpResultAttribute` on the HTTP response type.

## Rule description

Following the introduction of ASP.NET Core integration, for [functions with multiple output bindings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide?tabs=windows#multiple-output-bindings), the property in a custom output type correlating with the HTTP response is expected to be decorated with the `HttpResultAttribute`.

`HttpResponseData` does not require this attribute for multi-output functions to work because support for it was available before the introduction of ASP.NET Core Integration. However, this is the expected convention moving forward as all other HTTP response types in this scenario will not work without this attribute.

## How to fix violations

Add the attribute `[HttpResult]` (or `[HttpResultAttribute]`) to the relevant property. Example:

```csharp
public static class MultiOutput
{
    [Function(nameof(MultiOutput))]
    public static MyOutputType Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get")] HttpRequestData req,
        FunctionContext context)
    {
        ...
    }
}

public class MyOutputType
{
    [QueueOutput("myQueue")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [HttpResult]
    public HttpResponseData HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

This rule can be suppressed if there is no intention to migrate from `HttpResponseData` to other types (like `IActionResult`).
