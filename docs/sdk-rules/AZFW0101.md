| **Name** | ExtensionPackageConflict |
| **Category** | Sdk |
| **Severity** | Error |

## Cause

The same extension package was added multiple times with conflicting versions.

## Rule Description

Extension packages are resolved by scanning worker packages for declared extensions. When two worker packages request the same extension with different versions this error is produced. Only one version of an extension can be used at a time.

## How to Fix

Remove the worker packages which led to a conflict.
