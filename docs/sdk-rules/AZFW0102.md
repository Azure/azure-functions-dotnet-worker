# AZFW0102: Duplicate Extension Packages

| Item | Value |

| **Name** | ExtensionPackageDuplicate |
| **Category** | Sdk |
| **Severity** | Warning |

## Cause

The same extension package was added multiple times with identical versions.

## Rule Description

Extension packages are resolved by scanning worker packages for declared extensions. When two worker packages request the same extension with the same versions this warning is produced. It is expected an extension package is declared only once.

## How to Fix

Remove the worker packages which led to the duplicate.
