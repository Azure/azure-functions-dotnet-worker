# Azure.Functions.Sdk

The MSBuild SDK to use for building dotnet-isolated function apps.

This is intended to replace `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk` (which is at sdk/Sdk in this repo).

## Local Development.

To use this SDK for local development, run `dev.ps1`. The current terminal will then be able to resolve this SDK as `Azure.Functions.Sdk/99.99.99`.
