# Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.ApplicationInsights

This package adds extension methods and services to configure OpenTelemetry for use in Azure Functions .NET isolated applications.

This package does **not** add OpenTelemetry services directly. This must be done directly. Instead, this package only configures isolated application and resource detector.
